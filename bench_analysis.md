# Detailed Analysis of the Benchmark test results.

1. XZ Format: Compression (1MB)

    - Warming Up & Sampling:

        The benchmark warms up for 3 seconds and issues a warning stating that it couldn’t complete 10 samples in 5 seconds. This suggests that the compression operation is relatively heavy for a 1MB input, causing some samples to exceed the target time.

    - Measured Times:

        The 10 samples collected show a compression time in the range [561.93 ms, 567.02 ms] per sample.

        Throughput is reported as approximately 1.76–1.78 MiB/s.

    - Performance Change:

        The “change” section indicates that the compression time increased by roughly +3.37% to +4.47%. Correspondingly, throughput has decreased by approximately –3.26% to –4.28%.

        The phrasing “Performance has regressed” tells us that compared to the baseline, the current version of the compression operation is slightly slower.

        Outliers: One outlier (10% of samples) was identified as “high mild,” indicating that one sample took noticeably longer than the rest, which could be due to transient system load or a minor hiccup in the compression engine.

    - Interpretation:

        For a 1MB input, the overhead of the XZ encoder results in a relatively slow throughput. Given that XZ is tuned for high compression ratios (which often comes at the cost of speed), a throughput in the range of 1.76 MiB/s is plausible, though the slight regression might suggest either a change in the encoder’s internal parameters or environmental factors like system I/O performance.

2. XZ Format: Decompression (1MB)

    - Measured Times:

        Decompression times are very short, in the range [2.5473 ms, 2.5625 ms] for the 1MB file.

        This corresponds to a very high throughput, around 390.25–392.58 MiB/s.

    - Performance Change:

        The decompression time has improved dramatically by around 45.21% to 45.56% faster compared to the baseline.

        Throughput has increased by roughly 82.52% to 83.68%, indicating a significant performance improvement.

    - Interpretation:

        The decompression path for XZ is extremely efficient. It benefits from the fact that decompression is generally much faster than compression (a common trait of many compression algorithms). The substantial improvement in decompression performance could be due to optimizations in the underlying XZ library, improvements in caching, or more efficient buffer management in the current code version.

3. RSZ Format: Compression (10 Files)

    - Warming Up & Sampling:

        The RSZ archive benchmark warns that it was “Unable to complete 10 samples in 5.0s,” with a suggestion to increase the target time to around 82.9s. This indicates that compressing an archive with 10 files (each file being a fraction of the total SAMPLE_SIZE_MB) is significantly more time-consuming.

    - Measured Times:

        The reported compression times for the RSZ archive of 10 files range between 7.9331 s and 8.1931 s.

        Throughput is around 1.2205–1.2605 MiB/s.

    - Interpretation:

        The RSZ format includes additional metadata (such as file count, file names, and original sizes), and it has to process multiple files (even if each file is small). This additional overhead results in a lower compression throughput compared to the pure XZ compression for a single file. The absolute runtime is longer because of the I/O and metadata packaging overhead.

        For use cases where archiving many small files is required, this overhead might be acceptable depending on the priority of preserving per-file metadata versus raw speed.

4. RSZ Format: Decompression (10 Files)

    - Measured Times:

        The RSZ decompression for 10 files is reported as around 45.695 ms to 46.286 ms.

        Throughput is in the range of 216.05–218.84 MiB/s.

    - Interpretation:

        RSZ decompression is very fast. Even though the RSZ compression is slower (due to metadata and file handling overhead), decompression benefits from:

            The speed of XZ decompression (as RSZ relies on an XZ container for its data).

            The relatively small total amount of data to extract after metadata processing.

        The throughput of around 217 MiB/s is lower than the nearly 392 MiB/s measured for single-file XZ decompression, likely because of additional overhead reading and processing the custom metadata. However, it remains excellent given the multi-file nature of the archive.

# Overall Performance Comparison and Potential Implications

   * XZ Format vs. RSZ Format:

        Compression Speed:

            For a single 1MB file, XZ compression achieves about 1.76 MiB/s, but even there, it has suffered a slight regression.

            RSZ format, which handles 10 files, compresses at approximately 1.22 MiB/s. The slower speed is largely due to additional overhead for handling metadata and multiple file I/O.

        Decompression Speed:

            XZ decompression is extremely fast at nearly 390–392 MiB/s.

            RSZ decompression, even with extra metadata processing, still achieves about 217 MiB/s, which is very good given the complexity.

    * Performance Trade-offs:

        The RSZ format gives you the benefit of retaining per-file metadata (names, original sizes, etc.) which is crucial for multi-file archives, at the cost of extra compression time.

        XZ (single-file mode) offers very high decompression performance and slightly better throughput in compression for large data, but it loses per-file metadata.

    * Variance and Outliers:

        The XZ compression measurements indicate a slight regression and an outlier affecting the sample set. This suggests that further investigation might be necessary to understand why one sample took significantly longer—possible causes include system load variations, disk I/O contention, or intrinsic variance in the XZ encoding process.

    * Suggestions for Further Optimization:

        If compression speed is critical for RSZ archives, consider ways to optimize file I/O (e.g., parallel processing, batching metadata writes) or tune the XZ encoder parameters.

        For decompression, ensure that the metadata processing does not become a bottleneck—although current results are very promising.

        Review system conditions during benchmarking to ensure that external factors (like disk caching or CPU throttling) are not influencing the results.

# Conclusion

    Compression (XZ):

        Slight performance regression noted (+3.37% to +4.47% increased time) compared to the baseline, with throughput dropping by ~3–4%. This might be acceptable or could be a target for optimization.

    Decompression (XZ):

        Significant improvements (time reduced by ~45% and throughput increased by ~83%), making decompression exceptionally fast.

    RSZ Format:

        Provides additional metadata handling at the cost of slower compression speed (approximately 8 seconds for 10 files, i.e. ~1.22–1.26 MiB/s) but maintains excellent decompression speed (~45–46 ms, or ~217 MiB/s throughput).

        The additional overhead in RSZ compression is a trade-off for the extra file metadata that supports multi-file archiving.

The benchmark results illuminate the trade-offs involved in preserving per-file metadata (with RSZ) versus pure single-stream compression (XZ). While RSZ compression is noticeably slower due to overhead, its decompression remains highly efficient, which may be more important in many practical scenarios where archives are read more often than they are written.
